# In this we have to get product of all elements availabe in the matrix.
import numpy as np

#1. Using numpy.prod()
# a = [[1, 4, 5], [7, 3], [4], [46, 7, 3]]
# # Extract all Elements from matrix a.
# b = [ele for sub in a for ele in sub]   # Flattening
# res = np.prod(b)
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(res)


#2. List
# import math

# a = [[1, 4, 5], [7, 3], [4], [46, 7, 3]]
# b = [ele for sub in a for ele in sub]
# res = math.prod(b)
# print(res)
